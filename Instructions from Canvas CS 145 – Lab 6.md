Binary Search Tree Dictionary Lab  
Key topics:  
Printing, data types, methods, operators, expressions, variables, loops, recursion, parameters, returns,  
String objects, Scanner objects, and binary search trees  

**Learning Outcomes:**  
• Continue to become familiar with setup, design, execution and testing of Java programs  
• Design and develop a multi-class, multi-method program in good style  
• Demonstrate your understanding of recursion  
• Apply tools and techniques introduced in class to create a working program  
• Demonstrate your understanding of binary search trees  
### Task:  
Your task is to create a dictionary using a binary search tree to do an employee, customer, or member   lookup. You may use either recursion or iteration to implement this data structure. Your BST should give the user the option to use either pre-order, in-order, and post-order searches. 
You will name the file Dictionary.java. You will be including this in your GitHub portfolio that you will show off to  employers, so make it good.  
The database will start out empty, and each of the nodes will include first name, last name, street  
address, city, state, zip, e-mail, and phone number, along with a primary key for doing search, add, modify, and deletes.  

**Functional Rundown:**  
Upon executing your program, the console should display a menu (add, delete, modify, lookup, list
number of records. You don’t need to worry about sorting or balancing the tree. Based on the user’s prompt, it should ask the user for the appropriate information and carry out the assigned tasks.  
For Adds, it should prompt the user for the appropriate primary key, along with user data. The program should give the user confirmation about the data added.  
For Deletes, it should prompt the user for field to be deleted and confirm that the user wishes to delete  
this record. It should also confirm that the user wishes to delete the record.  
For Lookups, you should give the user option of pre-order, in-order, or post order, and print out the  
appropriate values.  
For Modify, the user should be prompted on which field(s) should be modified along with confirmation.

Creative Portion:  
In addition to the functionality of the calendar, your dictionary should display some text art (ACSII art)  
above the output. You have the freedom to choose what you display with these restrictions:  
• The ACSII art must be your own creation, not something found on the internet or elsewhere.  
• The picture should be appropriate and not include hateful, offensive, or inappropriate images.  
• You should not use advanced material beyond what we have learned in class so far.  
For this portion of the assignment, you will get credit for completing something that demonstrates you  
have put some effort into it. If you follow the guidelines above and it is clear in your code that you have  
put in effort, you will receive full points for the creative portion of the assignment. Don’t worry if you  
feel you are not particularly creative- something pretty basic will do as long as it meets the above  
requirements.  
Implementation Details:  
You are free to choose the names of the classes, methods, variables, and constants. Make sure that  
they follow the standard naming conventions covered in class. Be sure to include two to three classes,  
along with multiple methods for each class.  
Helpful Information:  
Feel free to take advantage of the websites and Utube sites that I’ve provided for your use.  
Please use one of the three IDEs (Intelli-J, Eclipse, or Visual Studio), along with GitHub. This will save you  
a lot of time in the long run.  
After you have got this working in Java, feel free to rewrite this program in either C, C++, or Python for  
extra credit.  
I strongly encourage you to tackle this assignment in parts and practice iterative design. Work on a few  
things and then test them to make sure they work. Then, add some more and test those. Don’t forget to  
turn in your pre-lab and post-lab along with this assignment. If you worked together on this as a team,  
make sure that you include the names of all the team members on the program in the comment header.  
Breaking Down the Assignment:  
This is a large project; I highly recommend breaking it down into pieces! Tackling this assignment  
method by method is a good strategy.

Style:  
It is important that you get used to writing code in good style. What is demonstrated in class is  
considered good style and there is a style guide on Canvas for your reference. Code written without  
proper style may lose points. As with the labs, proper naming conventions, indentation, a class  
comment, and method comments for all methods are expected.  
Extra Credit Opportunities (Optional):  
You can choose to do as many or as few of these as you would like. Each one completed successfully and  
in good style will earn some extra credit points for this assignment.  
1. As stated in the specification above, each calendar month will contain 35 days. For an added  
challenge, you can limit the number of days to 31. Completing this task successfully and in good  
style will result in extra credit.  
2. If your ascii art is truly remarkable, additional extra credit may be awarded. The complexity,  
uniqueness, and apparent time commitment poured into the art will be taken into  
consideration.
